                <h1>Social media and television</h1>have a number of connections and interrelationships. In the 2010s<a href="#"> Social media</a>
                and television broadcasting have a number of connections and interrelationships. In the 2010s,
                <a href="#">social media</a> technologies and <a href="#">websites</a> allow for television shows</a> to be accessed online on a range of
                desktop and mobile computer devices, <a href="#">smartphones</a> and <a href="#">smart TVs</a>. As well, online users can use social media
                websites to share digital video clips or excerpts from TV shows with fellow fans or even share an entire
                show online. Many social media websites enable users to post online comments on the programs—both negative
                and positive—in a variety of ways. Viewers can actively participate while watching a TV program by posting
                comments online, and have their interactions viewed and responded to in real time by other viewers. Technologies
                such as <a href="#">smartphones</a>, <a href="#">tablets</a>, and<a href="#">laptop</a> <a href="#">computers</a> allow viewers to watch downloaded digital files of TV
                shows or<a href="#"> "stream"</a> digital files of TV shows on a range of devices, both in the home and while on the go.
                In the 2010s, some television producers and broadcasters are encouraging active social media participation
                by viewers by posting "hashtags" on the TV screen during shows; these<a href="#"> hashtags</a> enable viewers to post online
                comments about the show, which may either be read by other social media users, or even, in some cases, displayed
                on the screen.

                    <figcaption>

                </pre>
                </figure>
                In contrast to pre-Internet TV viewing, which typically took place in a
                <a href="#"> family room</a> private home, in the 2010s, digital and Internet technologies enable viewers to watch show
                anytime, anywhere, regardless of the
                <a href="#"> over-the-air television
                </a> air times. For example, when a TV show is made available on a
                <a href="#"> streaming</a> service, viewers can watch the show on any day and at any time. Viewers with Internet-enabled
                mobile devices can even stream or download and watch a TV show while commuting on the bus or train. Television
                stations and programs have taken advantage of this new accessibility by incorporating aspects of
                <a href="#">
                    social media</a> into their programming, such as indicating social media websites where viewers and fans
                can post comments or participate in online activities. TV show producers are also using viewer comments from
                social media to improve their content or modify their marketing campaigns. TV show producers are also releasing
                video clips from live TV, including promotional
                <a href="#"> trailers</a>
                and excerpts from shows, on popular social media platforms, including
                <a href="#"> Facebook,</a>
                <a href="#"> Twitter</a> and
                <a href="#">Snapchat </a> generate additional advertising revenue and increase Internet users' awareness of and interest
                in their show. In some cases,
                <a href="#"> social media marketing</a> may be more effective at reaching a target market and less expensive than using
                "traditional" marketing approaches for TV shows, such as
                <a href="#"> TV commercials</a>. At the same time, TV shows using social media may face certain risks, as Internet users
                can post negative comments about the show online. In comparison with traditional marketing platforms, over
                which advertisers generally had a high level of control (e.g., a TV commercial), with social media, regular
                viewers can post critical comments directly under an TV show's online advertisement on a social media website.

            <hr>
            <p>
                Programs must decide on and promote a single
                <a href="#">"hashtag"</a> for a show which in turn becomes the show's official hashtag when fans post online comments
                about it. For example, the hashtag for Fox's
                <a href="#">Glee</a> is #glee; for shows with longer titles such as FX network's
                <a href="#"> American Horror Story</a>, an abbreviated hashtag is created, #AHSFX.[1] Some shows get creative with their
                hashtags,
                <a href="#">Showtime's</a>
                <a href="#">Shameless</a> uses #TeamGallagher to promote their show, Gallagher being the last name of the family in the
                show. A show's hashtag is usually placed on the lower corners of the screen during new airings of the show,
                to help guide viewers who want to make online comments. The first official integration between
                <a href="#">Twitter</a> hashtags television programs was during
                <a href="#">Comedy Central</a>'s March 15, 2011
                <a href="#">roast</a> of
                <a href="#">Donald Trump</a>. Using the hashtag #TrumpRoast at the bottom of the screen, Twitter called it "the single
                deepest integration of a Twitter hashtag on air-ever." The promotion worked, as it generated the channel's
                most-watched Tuesday in history; the hashtag #trumproast was used over 27,000 times on Twitter during the
                show's initial broadcast.[2]
